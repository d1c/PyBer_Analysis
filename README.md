# PyBer Analysis

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to use python and pandas to organize ride sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban & Rural. The data will then be analyzed and graphed using Matplotlib to provide insights needed to inform the corporate decision making process.

## Analysis Results

### Differences in City Types Data

The biggest difference between the cities is in the amount of data available for analysis. Rural areas averaged only 6 rides per city. On the contrary, suburban and urban areas averaged 17 and 24 rides per city. This allows more confidence in the urban and suburban dataset than in the rural dataset.

Viewing a few of the charts it is tempting to conclude that Rural city types may generate more revenue since the average fares are higher in rural areas. However, when additional analysis is viewed it becomes apparent that urban and suburban areas generate more revenue despite lower average fares per ride. 

### Presentation of Analysis

Figure #1 shows the dataset of all three city types in a bubble chart. The size of the bubbles is based on the number of drivers per city. The chart shows the majority of drivers and total number of drivers are both in Urban cities.

Figure #2 shows Total Fares by City Type. By a large margin Urban cities provide more than 62% of total fares.

Figure #3 shows Total Drivers by City Type. Again, this chart shows that over 80% of all drivers serve the large urban cities.

Figure #4 shows Total Rides by City Type. Rides in Urban cities represent over 68% of all rides.

Figure #5 shows PyBer Fare Summary. This summary chart provides the weekly breakdown of total fares by city type. As can be seen, Urban cities provide the highest weekly fares with Suburban cities second and rural cities coming in a distant third.

## Summary

To provide a more complete analyis we would recommend the company begin gathering additional data. For example, distance traveled per ride and the pick up and drop off location for each ride. These additional data points would allow the anaytics team to provide distance related metrics. Location information along with the time/date information already present in the dataset would allow us to plan where drivers may be needed.
